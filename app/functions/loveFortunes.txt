(S)he's just not that into you.
Nothing could ever split you two apart.
(S)he is thinking of you right now.
You make their world go round.
Love is not for the weak.
You look so good together.
Ask yourself: does (s)he spark joy?
(S)he loves you more than you can imagine.
You two will walk into the sunset.
(S)he can't stop thinking about you!
True love is built.
You make them want to dance.
You know it's meant to be.
Love won't just come knocking at your door.
Everyone searches for a love like this.
Look elsewhere.
Love is a two-way street.
Love someone who feels like home.
Marry that.
They love you at your darkest.
You will meet a short, pale stranger.
You will never be a second choice.
Just ask them out.
The stars have aligned. Love is coming your way.
Love is patient, love is kind. Looks like this isn't it.
People are naturally attracted to you.
Talk to that one person tomorrow.
Wink at that one person tomorrow, and watch what happens.
You attract the love you give.
You donâ€™t choose who you fall in love with.
The butterflies never go away.
