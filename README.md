Vision Statement: what would you tell potential customers?



Motivation: why are you working on this project?

We want to explore working with text processing and random string generators. We would like the opportunity to research the differences between randomly generated numbers and pseudorandom numbers. The topic of fortune telling allows for a lot of creativity in our design. For example, fortune outcomes could be placed in 3 categories: negative, neutral, or positive. We will then need to decide which category to pull from based on user input. We will also have flexibility with our implementation strategy. As long as the app meets the user expectations, we can implement our code however we want. We can experiment and find what works best for our needs.


Risks to project completion:

-
-
-
- We don’t have prior experience working together, so we are unfamiliar with each other’s strengths and weaknesses. This could also lead to communication struggles.
- We may encounter problems with our computers during the development process (i.e., someone could spill water on their laptop and not be able to use it), and lose access to part of our work if it hasn’t been stored elsewhere.
- There is a risk that the consumer will not be interested in our product, or that competing apps of a similar nature will offer more features or a more interesting/user-friendly interface. 

Mitigation strategy for above risks:
-
-
-
- We will remain in contact regularly on Slack and set up weekly Zoom meetings. We have been discussing our previous experience and strengths. We listen to each other and build onto each other’s ideas so this is a collaborative effort and everyone gets heard.
- We will back up our work to prepare for any accidents involving our personal computers. Each person will maintain backup copies of our group work, and add new versions to our Github repository as we have new working pieces. Another alternative to prevent losing work as a result of hardware problems is to store our code in a web IDE such as Jupyter, which we have all used regularly during the program and so are well acquainted with.
- We are currently collecting user stories. We can then build our features based on consumer needs and suggestions. If we know what the consumers want, then we can have confidence that consumers will be interested in our product. We will also research similar apps so we can differentiate our product from the current market. We will need to determine if the app already exists, and if it does, how can we separate ourselves so we have a unique spin. For example, an app might exist for one platform, but we could develop a similar app for a different platform.

Development method: scrum, kanban, waterfall: with specifics!

We will use Agile Development for our project, specifically, the Scrum Method. Our project does not have clear requirements because we want to experiment and adapt during development. The Scrum Method will allow us flexibility and early and continuous delivery. We want to tailor our product to user interest and Scrum will make it easier to incorporate the features from user stories. 

Our team includes 5 people, and we will organize from within our team. Kristin is the Scrum Master and will facilitate our Daily Scrums. We will have these Daily Scrums once or twice a week in Zoom since we are in a remote class environment. At the end of each Sprint, we will also review the product/feature and the efficacy of our current process and communication.We will maintain a sprint backlog. The product backlog is supposed to be owned by the product manager, but in this class environment we will be managing the product backlog. 

We may incorporate the Kanban’s method of visualizing tasks with a board on Trello. However, this will depend on what method of visualization works best for our team.


Project tracking software:
We plan to use Trello to track our progress. We like this platform because it provides a very visual way of keeping virtual boards and lists with pending and completed tasks. It will allow us to add comments on them to reflect obstacles, ask each other specific questions about them in an orderly way, and share useful links or attachments as needed. It is also good for assigning specific tasks to one team member or other, by creating individual lists on the main dashboard. We believe Trello will be a good tool for supporting our mitigation strategies of organizing tasks and working effectively as a team.
